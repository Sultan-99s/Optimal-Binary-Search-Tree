# Optimal-Binary-Search-Tree
Crispher is a very good coder. After reading anything he tries to implement it in code. About
a week ago he was reading about Optimal Binary Search tree. Now he wants to implement it
in the code but he finds some problem to do it. His solution was greedy as well as complexity
was high. So he wants someone who has good knowledge in Algorithms and knows how to
minimize complexity. He stated the problem as below:
Given a sorted array keys [0... n-1] of search keys and an array freq[0... n-1] of frequency
counts, where freq[i] is the number of searches to keys[i]. Construct an optimal binary search
tree of all keys such that the total cost of all the searches is as small as possible. For example:
Input: keys[] = {10, 12, 20}, freq[] = {34, 8, 50}

Now can you help Crispher to make it optimal and dynamic?
Use Dynamic Programming (DP) approachto find the optimal solution of the above stated
problem. Keep in mind that Brute Force solution is not alloed.
